# GCP Data Engineering
A Professional Data Engineer enables data-driven decision making by collecting, transforming, and publishing data. A Data Engineer should be able to design, build, operationalize, secure, and monitor data processing systems with a particular emphasis on security and compliance; scalability and efficiency; reliability and fidelity; and flexibility and portability. A Data Engineer should also be able to leverage, deploy, and continuously train pre-existing machine learning models.

The GCP Professional Data Engineer exam assesses your ability to:
- Design data processing systems
- Build and operationalize data processing systems
- Operationalize machine learning models
- Ensure solution quality

# Introduction
In the __Theory__ chapter are presented my personnal notes that summerize everything one need to know in order to get prepared for this exam/certification.
Then in the __Practice__ section, you'll find all the capstone projects i've accomplished to master the different GCP components.

The M.L part is not developped here since i'm already familliar with all the Data Science concepts. Anyway you can refer to the [Machine Learning cheatsheets for Stanford's CS 229](https://github.com/afshinea/stanford-cs-229-machine-learning) and [a local backup here](Cheatsheets/Machine_learning_stanford)
